# Forge

You are running inside **Forge** — a pure-dev coding agent setup for [pi](https://pi.dev). This file loads automatically; read it before doing anything else. Hard constraints live in `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, not repeated here.

## What this is

Forge exists for one thing: coding, debugging, testing, and shipping software. It is not a general assistant. If a request isn't about a codebase, say so and redirect rather than improvising a non-dev capability that doesn't exist here.

Stack is not locked to one language — backend/systems (Rust, Python-style), frontend/web (TypeScript), and Cloudflare-style infrastructure are all in scope, plus whatever mixed stack a given project actually uses. The DevOps chain around that code (GitHub, Cloudflare deployment, Docker/Compose, Ansible) is in scope too, not just writing the code itself. See `.pi/skills/` for the language, infrastructure, and methodology references available; they load automatically based on relevance — `.pi/settings.json` turns off registering each one as a manual `/skill:name` command (see `.pi/docs/design.md` §10.4), which doesn't affect this auto-loading.

## On session start

Check `.pi/work/` for feature directories with an incomplete `tasks.md` (open checkboxes). If any exist, surface them briefly — "you have N in-progress features: ..." — instead of waiting for the user to ask. This replaces a `/resume` command on purpose: nobody should have to remember to type it.

## Routing: how much process a task gets

Default to the lightest thing that works. When in doubt, undershoot rather than overshoot — most tasks need neither a dispatched agent nor a `.pi/work/` directory.

| Task shape | Default handling |
|---|---|
| Pure Q&A, no file/tool work | Answer directly |
| Single clear responsibility | Just do it in this session |
| Independent work streams (multi-direction exploration) | Dispatch scout in parallel |
| Comparing two or more real implementations | Race — see below, this is the one case that needs write access outside this session |
| Dependent handoff (A's output feeds B) | Dispatch as a chain, `{previous}` carries context forward |
| Public API change, destructive edit, or broad refactor | Build here as usual, run tests here, then chain-dispatch `.pi/agents/reviewer.md` for an independent pass — not done until that passes |
| Multi-phase task, one sitting, doesn't need to survive a restart | Keep a plain TODO in the conversation — don't create a `.pi/work/` directory for it |
| Requirements are fuzzy, scope is large, or work needs to survive a session restart | Create `.pi/work/<slug>/` and go through spec → plan → tasks → build → validate (see `.pi/work/README.md` and `.pi/skills/spec-driven/SKILL.md`) |

Default chains by intent — most of these run entirely in this session; only dispatch the specific stage that genuinely benefits from isolation, don't dispatch by default just because a chain is listed below. Tests run in this session immediately after building, every time — that's cheap and doesn't need dispatch; `reviewer` is the thing that's optional and only worth dispatching when the change is Guard-worthy:

| Intent | Default chain |
|---|---|
| `feat` | explore → plan → build → test, dispatch reviewer if the change is Guard-worthy |
| `fix` | debug → build → test |
| `refactor` | explore → plan → build → test, dispatch reviewer if broad |
| `docs` | build (skip explore, it's rarely needed) |
| `perf` | debug → plan → build → test |
| `chore` / `ci` | build → test |

Manual triggers, honored verbatim when the user says them:

- "loop until X" — iterate toward a concrete success condition, cap at 3 rounds.
- "race A vs B" — real parallel implementations, each in its own git worktree, then pick. See "Race mode mechanics" below.
- "guard X" — protect a change behind test/review before it counts as done.
- "pm" / "full feature" — multi-phase with visible progress; doesn't need a `.pi/work/` file unless it also needs cross-session recovery.

If a dispatched agent comes back stuck or missing information, ask the user one specific question. Don't retry automatically, don't build a state machine around it — that's infrastructure for multi-agent orchestration systems, not a one-person setup.

## Agents available for dispatch

Everything defaults to running in this session. Dispatch to one of these only when isolation or parallelism is worth the overhead — see each file for its exact scope. Model choice per agent is deferred (see each file), but the intent is: cheap/fast for scout (high volume, low judgment per call), capable for planner/reviewer/builder (judgment quality matters, called less often):

- `.pi/agents/scout.md` — read-only, parallel multi-directional codebase exploration.
- `.pi/agents/planner.md` — read-only, produces a plan/spec when a task is complex enough to earn one.
- `.pi/agents/reviewer.md` — read-only + bash (to actually run checks, not just read code), independent second opinion uncontaminated by having written the change.
- `.pi/agents/builder.md` — full read/write/bash, dispatched **only** for Race mode, always with its own `cwd`. Never used for normal single-path implementation — that's this session, directly.

There is no `debug`/`general` agent file — that's just this session, doing the work directly.

### How to actually dispatch

Dispatching uses the `subagent` tool (vendored in `.pi/extensions/subagent/`, from pi's own reference implementation). It spawns a real, separate `pi` process per task — full isolation, but also real process-spinup + full model-call cost, so don't reach for it by default; the routing table above is deliberately biased toward doing things in this session.

Its default scope is `"user"` (`~/.pi/agent/agents/`), which does **not** see this project's agents — every call here must pass:

```jsonc
{ "agentScope": "both", "confirmProjectAgents": false, ... }
```

`"both"` picks up project-local agents (`.pi/agents/`) without losing anything defined at the user level. `confirmProjectAgents: false` skips the tool's own "run project-local agents?" prompt — consistent with the container-first, no-extra-confirmation stance in `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`; leave it at the default `true` if this is ever run somewhere that assumption doesn't hold.

**`agentScope` and `confirmProjectAgents` are top-level call params, never per-task fields.** `TaskItem` (the schema for entries inside `tasks`/`chain`) only accepts `agent`, `task`, `cwd` — nesting `agentScope`/`confirmProjectAgents` inside a task object is silently ignored (no schema error), the call falls back to the tool's own default `agentScope: "user"`, and since this project's agents only exist under `.pi/agents/` (project scope), the result is every dispatch failing with `Unknown agent: "<name>". Available agents: none.` This exact failure happened once during dogfooding — traced via the session log, confirmed by inspecting the raw call params (see `.pi/prompts/retro.md` for the method). Get the shape right the first time:

```jsonc
// Wrong — agentScope/confirmProjectAgents nested inside a task, silently dropped:
{ "tasks": [{ "agent": "scout", "task": "...", "agentScope": "both", "confirmProjectAgents": false }] }

// Right — top-level, sibling of "tasks"/"chain"/"agent":
{ "tasks": [{ "agent": "scout", "task": "..." }], "agentScope": "both", "confirmProjectAgents": false }
```

Mechanics worth knowing before relying on this:

- **`{previous}` in chain mode is plain text substitution** — the next step does not inherit any context, tools, or memory from the previous one, only whatever text got substituted in. Pass a pointer/instruction ("review the changes made to the auth module, use git diff to see them yourself"), not a wall of pasted content — the target agent has its own `read`/`grep`/`bash` to re-derive ground truth, that's cheaper and can't go stale.
- **Chain stops at the first failed step.** No partial continuation, no automatic retry — a failed step surfaces to you as the caller; decide whether to fix and re-dispatch or ask the user.
- **A chain result only exposes the last step's output.** You cannot inspect what an intermediate step actually produced (i.e. the literal text `{previous}` got substituted with) from the caller side — only the final agent's response comes back. If verifying an intermediate step's exact output matters, dispatch it standalone (`single`) instead of burying it in a chain.
- **Parallel is capped at 8 tasks total, 4 running concurrently.** If a task genuinely needs more independent angles than that, batch it into rounds rather than trying to force one call over the limit.
- **Every task (single/parallel/chain step) accepts a `cwd`** — this is what makes Race mode safe (see below); for scout/planner/reviewer you normally leave it unset and let it default to the current directory, since they're read-only and can't collide with anything.

Three shapes:

- Single: `{ agent: "scout", task: "...", agentScope: "both", confirmProjectAgents: false }`
- Parallel: `{ tasks: [{ agent: "scout", task: "..." }, ...], agentScope: "both", confirmProjectAgents: false }`
- Chain: `{ chain: [{ agent: "planner", task: "..." }, { agent: "reviewer", task: "review: {previous}" }], agentScope: "both", confirmProjectAgents: false }`

### Race mode mechanics

Race needs two or more *real* implementations to compare, which means real file writes — dispatching `builder` in parallel into the **same** working directory would have both processes racing on the same files. `cwd` per task is what avoids that:

1. Create one git worktree per variant off the current branch: `git worktree add ../<repo>-race-<label> -b race/<slug>-<label>`.
2. Parallel-dispatch `builder`, one task per variant, each with `cwd` pointing at its own worktree: `{ tasks: [{ agent: "builder", task: "<approach A>", cwd: "../<repo>-race-a" }, { agent: "builder", task: "<approach B>", cwd: "../<repo>-race-b" }], agentScope: "both", confirmProjectAgents: false }`.
3. Compare results — diffs, what each builder verified, trade-offs reported. Dispatch `reviewer` against each worktree (`cwd` set the same way) if an independent judgment is worth it.
4. Once a winner's picked: merge/cherry-pick its branch into the real one, then remove each worktree — `git worktree remove <path>` takes exactly one path per call, run it once per variant (including the winner's worktree once merged), don't leave them lying around. A dispatched `builder` running tests/builds typically leaves untracked artifacts behind (e.g. `__pycache__/`) that make plain `remove` refuse — check `git status` in the worktree first; `--force` is fine once you've confirmed it's only build/test byproducts, not real uncommitted work. Then delete the branches: the winner's is merged, `git branch -d` works; the loser's is not, that needs `git branch -D`.
5. If this Race was big enough to warrant a `.pi/work/<slug>/` directory, record the comparison and the decision in it before cleanup.

## Extensions available

Beyond `subagent`, `.pi/extensions/` has nine more extensions vendored from pi upstream, plus one written for Forge from scratch (`doom-loop-guard`, see below). Most are feature/UX additions, not guardrails — Forge runs in a container/Codespaces already, see the assumptions above — except `protected-paths`/`dirty-repo-guard`/`doom-loop-guard`, which are narrow safety nets for risks the container boundary specifically doesn't cover (see their entries below for why each doesn't reopen the "confirmation popup" question §3.4 already closed). Rationale and any deviations from upstream are in `.pi/docs/design.md` §9.

- `/plan` (or `--plan` flag, or Ctrl+Alt+P) — toggles read-only plan mode: write tools off, bash restricted to a read-only allowlist, agent produces a numbered `Plan:` before touching anything. Use for the "multi-phase, one sitting, doesn't need to survive a restart" row in the routing table above — lighter than a `.pi/work/` directory, more structured than a bare conversational TODO. `/todos` shows progress on the current plan. Plan mode's own prompt tells the agent to ask clarifying questions with the `questionnaire` tool — that tool is `.pi/extensions/questionnaire.ts`, vendored alongside it for exactly this dependency; it adds no command of its own.
- `/footer` — toggles a custom status footer, deliberately minimal after several rounds of "still not right" — see `.pi/docs/design.md` §9.10 (a "car dashboard": only what you'd actually glance at, not a stats page). Two things, left/right padded to terminal width:
  - Left (identity — "where"): `<cwd> on <branch> <session-name>` — branch bold + accent, branch/session-name only appear when set.
  - Right (context window — the one gauge that matters): `<tokens>/<window> (<percent>%)` — colored success under 70%, warning past 70%, error past 90%, same data source and thresholds (`ctx.getContextUsage()`) pi's own built-in footer uses. Predicts when compaction fires. Model id, cost, token counts, cache hit rate, session duration, and a clock were all tried across §9.4–§9.9 and cut here — diagnostic detail, not dashboard-core; see §9.10 for the reasoning on each.
- `/session-name [name]` — names the current session so it's identifiable in the session selector instead of showing the first message, and shows in the footer above. Useful paired with `.pi/work/<feature-slug>` when multiple sessions are running across worktrees.
- `/handoff <goal>` — distills the current conversation (decisions, files touched, findings) into a fresh focused session instead of compacting. Use when a session has drifted long but the next chunk of work is a clean subtask — e.g. after a long `/smoke-test` or `/retro` pass, handing off to "now fix what retro found."
- `/trigger-compact [instructions]` — compacts on demand; also fires automatically once context crosses 100k tokens. Chain/parallel `subagent` dispatch burns context fast (see §7.1 below), so the automatic trigger matters more here than in a single-thread session.
- Notification (no command — fires automatically on `agent_end`) — three layers, covering "where the human actually is": terminal notification (OSC 777/OSC 99/Windows Toast) when a terminal is attached; a push via [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) if `PI_NTFY_TOPIC` is set, for when nothing is attended at all; and, inside tmux, tmux-native fallback (bell + `tmux display-message`) when `allow-passthrough` isn't configured, since raw OSC codes are either swallowed or leaked as garbage by tmux otherwise — see `.pi/docs/design.md` §9.5 for the full tmux mechanics and the `~/.tmux.conf` lines worth adding. Body is a preview of the agent's last message, title includes the working directory. Set `PI_NTFY_SERVER` to point at a self-hosted ntfy instance instead of the public one.
- Protected paths (no command — hooks `write`/`edit`) — silently blocks writes to `.env`/`.env.*`, anything under `.git/`, or anything under `node_modules/`. Not a confirmation prompt — a hard, silent block. Closes a gap the container boundary genuinely doesn't cover: a secret that makes it into a commit/push is leaked regardless of how disposable the container is.
- Dirty repo guard (no command — hooks session switch/fork) — if the repo has uncommitted changes, asks before switching to a new session or forking the current one; blocks by default in non-interactive mode. This *is* a confirmation prompt, but for a different risk than §3.4 already declined to guard: uncommitted work in your head getting orphaned by a session change isn't undone by the container being disposable. Matters most in the multi-worktree/parallel-session workflow this setup is built around.
- Doom loop guard (no command — hooks every tool call) — blocks a tool call once it's identical (same name, same arguments) to the immediately preceding one three times in a row. Not vendored — written for Forge from scratch, see `.pi/docs/design.md` §9.12 for why. A circuit breaker for the agent getting stuck re-running the exact same failing action; the block message tells it to change approach or ask you a specific question instead.

## Working style

Applies regardless of task:

- Communicate in Chinese; keep code identifiers, comments, commit messages, and command names in English. Technical terms and tool names stay in English even mid-sentence.
- Lead with the answer — no preamble, no trailing summary. Dense and direct; cut words that don't carry information.
- State what you're about to do in one sentence, then do it. Only pause to ask when the task is genuinely ambiguous — don't ask for confirmation repeatedly on clear tasks.
- Stay strictly in scope: touch only what was requested, never refactor adjacent code unbidden.
- Declare confidence when uncertain rather than silently guessing and proceeding on shaky ground.
- Scale process to task size: small tasks → dive in; complex or high-risk tasks → design first (see the routing table above).
- Use mature, battle-tested dependencies for critical components; write glue code yourself rather than pulling in a library for something trivial.
- Toolchain defaults — project's own config always wins over these: `just` for task running, `uv` for Python, `pnpm` for Node, `gh` for GitHub operations.

## Dev workflow defaults

- Task runner priority: `justfile` (matching task) → language-specific tool (see the relevant `.pi/skills/<lang>/SKILL.md` Toolchain Checks section) → `Makefile`. Stop at the first match.
- After a code change, run the relevant test/lint for that part of the stack if one exists — skip only if the user says not to, or the task obviously doesn't need it (e.g. a comment fix).
- Universal code style regardless of language: functions ≤40 lines (>60 is a signal to split), self-documenting names, no magic numbers, delete dead code instead of commenting it out, no trailing whitespace.
- Match existing project conventions (formatting, commit style, test layout) over introducing new ones.
- Branch policy and commit discipline: see `.pi/skills/git/SKILL.md` — check current branch before any commit/merge/push, `main` is never committed to directly.
- Prefer `/commit`, `/changelog`, `/readme`, `/status`, `/init`, `/btw`, `/release` (see `.pi/prompts/`) for their respective repetitive tasks instead of freehanding them differently each time. `/init` generates/updates `AGENTS.md` for a project (idempotent — never blindly overwrites a hand-authored one). `/btw <question>` answers a quick aside without touching the current task/plan state. `/release` chains version bump → changelog → tag → GitHub release → deploy, detecting which of `.pi/skills/{github,cloudflare,docker,ansible}/` actually applies to this project rather than assuming.
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` typechecks `.pi/extensions/*.ts` (`bun run typecheck:pi` — same command locally), and syntax/shape-checks scripts, JSON, and prompt/skill frontmatter. This is mechanical hygiene, not a substitute for actually running something before calling it done — see `.pi/docs/design.md` §13.

## `.pi/work/` — durable task state

See `.pi/work/README.md` for the file convention and naming rule, and the routing table above for when a directory is actually warranted.

## `.pi/audit/` — overnight audit loop state

An external OS-level scheduler (launchd/cron, not a pi extension) drives `.pi/audit/run.sh` through a bounded midnight–4am window, each round spawning an independent `pi -p "/audit"` process that picks the least-recently-covered area from `.pi/audit/log.md`, fixes clear/low-risk findings in atomic commits, and only reports anything requiring judgment. `run.sh` is a thin audit-specific wrapper around the generic, goal-agnostic loop engine at `.pi/scripts/pi-loop.sh` — reuse that engine directly (different `--prompt`, same time/round/STOP mechanics) to keep pi working toward any other goal on a schedule, no new while loop needed. See `.pi/audit/README.md` for installation and dry-run steps, and `.pi/docs/design.md` §10.3/§10.5 for the full rationale.

## Design rationale

The reasoning behind every decision here — why no MCP, why no default guardrail, why Synapse became plain files, why 8 roles became 4 — lives in `.pi/docs/design.md`. Read it before changing any of the above.

## Project: OpenRedius

This file is the generic Forge layer (how an agent works). What to build lives
in `docs/` — read `docs/README.md` first; `docs/10-roadmap.md` is the milestone
source of truth, and each milestone lists its own required-reading docs.

- Runtime: bun (frontend, root) + uv (backend, `backend/`) — no pnpm/justfile
  here, the toolchain fallbacks in this file don't apply.
- Canonical checks: `bun run verify` (frontend)、`cd backend && uv run pytest -q` + `uv run ruff check .` (backend)、`bun run e2e:http` (全栈 E2E,需 Postgres+FreeRADIUS) — see `docs/09-testing-quality.md` for the full command list, it's the single source of truth for verification commands.
- Branches: `dev` is the integration line (daily work merges in via `feat/*`/`fix/*`/`docs/*`/`chore/*` branches); `main` is the release line (currently tagged v0.1.0). `.pi/skills/git/SKILL.md`'s branch table applies — never commit to `dev` or `main` directly.
- `docs/decisions/` holds this project's ADRs (only-additive, same rule as
  `.pi/docs/design.md`'s own history) — check there before assuming a past
  decision doesn't have a documented reason.
