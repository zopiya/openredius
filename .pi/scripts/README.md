# `.pi/scripts/` — standalone tooling, external to pi itself

Scripts here are plain OS-level tools that happen to shell out to the `pi`
binary — they don't depend on pi's extension system, don't require the
project to be "in a pi session," and have no opinion about what any
particular goal/prompt does. Contrast with `.pi/extensions/` (loaded inside
a pi process) and `.pi/prompts/` (expanded inside a pi session) — everything
here runs *outside* pi and drives it from the command line.

## `pi-loop.sh`

Generic external loop driver: repeatedly invokes `pi -p "<prompt>"` as
independent, one-shot, non-interactive processes until a time window, round
cap, or STOP-file condition is hit. Domain-agnostic on purpose — it has zero
knowledge of what the prompt does or what "done" means; goal-specific logic
(e.g. git branch/dirty-tree handling) plugs in via `--precheck` and
`--post-round-check` hooks (arbitrary shell commands, checked by exit code
only) rather than being special-cased inside the engine.

Run `.pi/scripts/pi-loop.sh --help` for the full option list.

See `.pi/audit/run.sh` for a real example: it owns everything audit-specific
and calls this engine to do the actual looping. To make pi keep working
toward a *different* goal on a schedule, write a new prompt (or reuse an
existing one) and call `pi-loop.sh` directly — no new while loop needed.

Rationale for why this lives outside pi entirely (not an extension/timer) is
in `.pi/docs/design.md` §10.3/§10.5.
