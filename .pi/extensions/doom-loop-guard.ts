/**
 * Doom Loop Guard Extension
 *
 * Blocks a tool call once it repeats the immediately preceding call(s)
 * identically (same tool name + same input) past a small threshold — a
 * circuit breaker for the agent getting stuck re-running the exact same
 * failing action and expecting a different result.
 *
 * Written for Forge, not vendored — inspired by the general idea behind
 * third-party "doom loop" detector packages seen on pi.dev/packages (see
 * .pi/docs/design.md §9.12), but no external source was read or copied; this is
 * a from-scratch minimal implementation, deliberately matching the same
 * `tool_call`-blocking shape already used by
 * `.pi/extensions/plan-mode/index.ts` and `.pi/extensions/protected-paths.ts`
 * rather than inventing a new mechanism.
 *
 * Known simplification, stated up front rather than discovered later: calls
 * are compared by shape only (tool name + JSON-serialized input), not by
 * result — a call that legitimately needs to repeat (e.g. polling for a
 * background job to finish) would still count toward the streak. Forge has
 * no background-polling extension installed, so this trade-off favors
 * catching real loops over accommodating a case that doesn't exist in this
 * setup today; revisit if that changes.
 *
 * Hardened in the same pass as .pi/docs/design.md §9.13's robustness audit:
 * JSON.stringify on tool input can throw (circular structures etc.) — a
 * broken guard shouldn't be the reason a real tool call fails, so an
 * unserializable input is now treated as unclassifiable (streak reset, call
 * allowed) instead of throwing out of the tool_call hook.
