/**
 * Protected Paths Extension
 *
 * Blocks write and edit operations to protected paths.
 * Useful for preventing accidental modifications to sensitive files.
 *
 * Vendored from earendil-works/pi packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions
 * (same vendoring pattern as .pi/extensions/subagent/, see .pi/docs/design.md).
 *
 * Deviations from upstream (see .pi/docs/design.md §9.12):
 * - Reads `event.input.file_path` as a fallback when `path` is absent. The
 *   built-in write/edit tools accept both field names (dist/core/tools/write.js:
 *   `args?.file_path ?? args?.path`) — upstream only read `path`, which throws
 *   on `undefined.includes()` the moment a model emits `file_path` instead
 *   (the same "assumed field name" class of bug already fixed once this
 *   session for the scout/planner/reviewer/builder tool lists).
 * - Matches by path *segment* instead of substring. Upstream's
 *   `path.includes(".env")` also blocks unrelated files like
 *   `some.envfile.txt`; `.git/`/`node_modules/` substring checks had the same
 *   false-positive risk for oddly-named paths. Now checks the exact basename
 *   (`.env` or `.env.*`) and exact directory segments (`.git`,
 *   `node_modules`) after normalizing `\` to `/`, so it behaves the same on
 *   Windows-style paths too.
 *
 * Deliberately no confirmation prompt — this is a silent hard block, not the
 * "confirm before destructive action" guardrail APPEND_SYSTEM.md/§3.4
 * already decided against. The container boundary doesn't undo a secret
 * that already made it into a commit/push; that's the specific gap this
 * closes.
